<p align="center"><i>  Blogging is love and war. </i>

<hr>
<p>From my 10+ years of writing daily, I can tell you there will be moments when you’re chock-full of motivation. Ideas leap off your mind and straight onto the page. You get inspired by the thought of creating content that will generate massive buzz.</p>

<p>
And there are other moments when the excitement is reduced to a glimmer. You jump from half-baked idea to half-baked idea, taking up hours of your time, before getting to that last sentence. You teeter on the verge of giving up.
</p>

<p>
It happens to all of us.

Even the best writers have the same wishy-washy relationship with blogging.

And do you know what? We have no choice but to pull through.

Blog posts are still the #1 asset for engaging with your audience and generating warm leads for your business.

In fact, marketers who use blogs generate 67% more leads than those who don’t. Not only that, blog posts cost 62% less per lead than outbound marketing.
